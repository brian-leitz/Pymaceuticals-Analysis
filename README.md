Data Visualization for Pymaceuticals, INC

This code uses Pandas via Jupyter notebook to analyze drug data in a study conducted on 249 Mice who received treatment via a range of drug regimens. This analysis examines the average weight and size of each tumor, and displays visualizations and linear regression models as part of the analysis. This analysis combines data from two csv files to create one larger merged dataset. 

Analysis

249 mice conducted by Pymaceuticals revealed some insights. The sex distribution of the mice were rougly equal, with 50% being male and 50% being female. Additionally, 9 different drug regimens were tested, including a placebo. Out of all these drug regimens, Ramicane appeared to be the most effective at reducing tumor growth, as it had the lowest mean, median, variance, and standard deviation among the tested drugs. Capomulin was also effective, and both drugs had the highest number of timepoints. The correlation and regression analysis revealed a strong positive relationship between tumor volume and mouse weight, with a correlation of 0.84. Overall, Ramicane and Capmulin were found to be the most effective drugs in reducing tumor growth among the tested regimens.
